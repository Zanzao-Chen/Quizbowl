This project was used to coach my high school Quizbowl team without the need for expensive buzzer equipment. Cutting down costs was important for our team, as we were starting from scratch. Unlike existing solutions, this project allowed us to directly chat within the application, which was important as COVID required us to meet remotely. In addition, the milisecond-level precision for buzzing in provided us with targeted feedback, which other projects did not have. Eventually, we were able to achieve 3rd place nationally in the China National Academic Quizbowl Tournaments (NAQT).
